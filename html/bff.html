                <h5>Description:</h5>

                <p>
                    Best Friends Forever is a 2D platformer and AI interactive experience. You play as Cassie, a tech-savvy and music loving
                    16 year-old girl, who is dealing with the loss of her best friend, Jamie. In order to cope with Jamie's passing, Cassie
                    trains an AI chatbot to talk just like Jamie. Using the OpenAI API, the player is able to chat with Jamie directly.
                </p>

                <h5>My Role:</h5>

                <p>
                    I worked in a team of three, where each person took on a leadership role - either Lead Producer, Lead Artist, or Lead
                    Programmer - while also contributing as a <strong>Game Designer</strong>. Although we had defined roles, we all actively collaborated on
                    every aspect of the game, going beyond our primary responsibilities. As the <strong>Lead Programmer</strong>, my responsibilities
                    included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Oversaw the technical development of the game, coded core mechanics and enemy behaviors, implemented  systems, art assets, and animations</li>
                        <li>Designed and iterated the game's narrative, ensuring it aligned with gameplay mechanics and themes, while refining player engagement throughout the process</li>
                        <li>Integrated the OpenAI API, enabling players to chat directly with the AI-powered version of Jamie</li>
                        <li>Wireframed and implemented the UI, including the dialogue and texting screen</li>
                        <li>Conducted formal playtests, created a questionnaire to gather player feedback, and analyzed results to refine gameplay mechanics</li>
                        <li>Drew, planned, and designed a platforming level</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h5>Tools Used:</h5>

                <ul>
                    <li>Unity</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>OpenAI API</li>
                    <li>Perforce</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Best Friends Forever was the final project for CTIN 541 Design for Interactive Media with Tracy Fullerton, during my
                    first semester at USC. Working on this game was an incredible learning experience. One of the most unique and intriguing
                    aspects was our implementation of ChatGPT. We received a wide range of reactions from players - some felt disconnected
                    from the narrative, while others found the AI to be highly immersive. This became one of our biggest challenges, as much
                    of the experience hinged on how players interacted with the AI character. To ensure the AI responded in a meaningful
                    way, we had to pre-prompt it by describing the character it was meant to portray, outlining how it should engage with
                    players, and guiding its responses to make sure the narrative was effectively communicated.
